# This askpass utility retrieves a sudo password from the Mac keychain.
# It assumes that sudo passwords can be located using the service name
# "sudo passwords" and that the account name will be "sudo:<hostname>"
# for a given host.

# Note that you can easily add your sudo password to your keychain by
# using this exact same command and just replacing
# `find-generic-password` with `add-generic-password`
security find-generic-password -s "sudo passwords" -a "sudo:$(hostname)" -w
